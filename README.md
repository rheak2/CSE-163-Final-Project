Step 1: Install Camelot library
    https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install.html
    you do NOT need to install ghostscript. All of our files are processed using flavor='Stream'

Step 2: Running python program
    The main.py file.
    You do NOT need to run the process_loc.py file, and the code in that file is not called in any
    other file. This is because Running process_loc.py takes >3 hours to run. The function adds a csv file
    to our folder, and this csv is processed in other files. Processing the csv takes less than 2 seconds.
    To demonstrate how we converted the pdf into a csv file, we included the code in process_loc.py.
